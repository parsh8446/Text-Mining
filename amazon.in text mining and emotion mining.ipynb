       " '\\n\\n  Apple provides the class as we all know. This one got good display , screen quality , processor and camera . I was expecting much more from battery part as i play games heavily and i am not very happy but just satisfied that apple can try to create better battery life .Only buy if you want to but not if you expect everything to be great .Edit : This phone heats up after 30-40 mins of heavy gaming like COD or MC5\\n\\n',\n",

Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion is a different feel altogether.-Cinematic mode is one brilliant addition and shifts focus automatically in your videos-  macro photography is goodMust say it’s worth It\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Switched from S21 Ultra and it is worth it. My second apple device after 4s. Feels premium and feature rich the pro motion is way better than the 120Hz in the S21 Ultra. Plus no heating issue which i was facing in the former. Only downside is it has a heft to it. Highly recommended device.\\n\\n']"
